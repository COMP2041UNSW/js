# Js Notes

These are some notes that were written during the first iteration of JS in 2041 to act as a general highlight real of the content being taught. These are provided as a reference this year but please note that the lecture slides should be your main source of truth for what to expect in the exam as content may deviate this session.

1. [Getting started with JavaScript](render.html?p=notes/basics/index.md)
2. [Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)](render.html?p=notes/dom/index.md)
3. [JavaScript and async programming](render.html?p=notes/async/index.md)

## Disclaimer:
Learning any programming language in three weeks is **impossible**,
and JavaScript is no exception. While the below attempts to provide a fairly
comprehensive overview, there is lots of detail and depth left out to aid you
to 'get going' faster. This comes at a cost!
