# COMP2041 JavaScript Course Material

This repo contains Tutorial and Lab material for COMP2041 Software Construction.
To use this material to its full extent requires running an http server in the project root.
Sound complicated? It's not, we've made all the hard stuff simple.

Just do this.
```bash
# in this directory
$ npm install

# And .. you're done
$ npm start

# or with node on the cse lab machines
$ 2041 http-server
```

## Tests
Tests can be run via the commands below:

```bash
# run all node based tests
npm test 
```

## Resources
Along with the labs and tutorials there are a number of links and lessons, in addition to the course website available below.
We strongly encourage you to read as much as you can, watch videos to get a better sense of the language and
best practice web development.

## Disclaimer:
Learning any programming language in three weeks is **impossible**,
and JavaScript is no exception. While the above attempts to provide a fairly
comprehensive overview, there is lots of detail and depth left out to aid you
to 'get going' faster. This comes at a cost!
